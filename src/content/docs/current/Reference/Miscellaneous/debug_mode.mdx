Iris provides a debug mode with several features to facilitate development of shaders. Debug mode can be enabled in two ways:

1. In the in-game Shader Selection screen (`Options > Video Settings > Shader Packs`, default keybind <kbd>O</kbd>) press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> (Windows / Linux) or <kbd>Cmd + D</kbd> (macOS)
2. Set the `enableDebugOptions` field to `true` in Iris's settings file (`/config/iris.properties`)

:::caution[Warning]
On some GPU drivers, such as the AMD driver on Windows, enabling debug mode can cause the game to crash on startup. This can be resolved by setting `use_no_error_g_l_context` to `false` in `.minecraft/config/sodium-options.json` or by disabling the no error context in the game's settings (if you have the power of foresight).

Debug mode's features are as follows:

- **Patched code output**: code generated by the [Iris patcher](/current/reference/miscellaneous/patcher/) is saved to `/patched_shaders/`. This is useful because
  - The line numbers Iris provides in error messages correspond to this patched code, not your original code.
  - The patcher can occasionally make mistakes, especially if your code is malformed in some way. Being able to see the output it produces is crucial in resolving these issues.
- **Error window**: If the shader fails to compile, the error message will be displayed directly on the screen, instead of only being printed to the log.
