**Buffers** are dedicated areas of memory used to temporarily store color data, depth information, or any other information used for rendering. The following are buffers Iris/OptiFine makes available by default, some of which can be written to and read from, and some of which can only be read from.

| Sampler                                                  | [Format](/current/reference/buffers/image_format/) | Size                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [`colortexN`](/current/reference/buffers/colortex)       | `RGBA`*                                            | Display Resolution*       |
| [`depthtexN`](/current/reference/buffers/depthtex)       | `DEPTH24_STENCIL8` / `DEPTH32F_STENCIL8`†          | Display Resolution        |
| [`noisetex`](/current/reference/buffers/noisetex)        | `RGB8`*                                            | Noise Texture Resolution* |
| [`shadowtexN`](/current/reference/buffers/shadowtex)     | `DEPTH24_STENCIL8` / `DEPTH32F_STENCIL8`†          | Shadow Map Resolution*    |
| [`shadowColorN`](/current/reference/buffers/shadowcolor) | `RGBA`*                                            | Shadow Map Resolution*    |

<sup>†Dependent on drivers</sup>

Also provided are three [texture atlases](/current/reference/buffers/atlases/). These have the format `RGBA8` and their resolution can be determined with [`atlasSize`](/current/reference/uniforms/rendering/#atlassize).

On Iris, additional buffers can be created through through the use of [custom textures](/current/reference/buffers/custom_textures/), [custom images](/current/reference/buffers/custom_images/), and [SSBOs](/current/reference/buffers/ssbo/)
