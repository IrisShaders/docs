**Buffers** are dedicated areas of memory used to temporarily store color data, depth information, or any other information used for rendering. The following are buffers Iris/OptiFine make available by default, some of which can be written to and read from, and some of which can only be read from.

| Sampler                                                | [Format](/current/reference/buffers/image)         | Size                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| [`colortexN`](/current/reference/buffers/colortex)     | `RGBA`*        | Display Resolution*     |
| [`depthtexN`](/current/reference/buffers/colortex)     | `R24` / `R32`† | Display Resolution      |
| [`noisetex`](/current/reference/buffers/colortex)      | `RGB8`*        | 256 x 256               |
| [`shadowtexN`](/current/reference/buffers/shadowtex)   | `R24` / `R32`† | Shadow Map Resolution*  |
| [`shadowColorN`](/current/reference/buffers/colortex)  | `RGBA`*        | Shadow Map Resolution*  |

<sup>*Configurable</sup><br/>
<sup>†Dependent on drivers</sup>

Also provided are three [texture atlases](/reference/Buffers/atlases.mdx). These have the format `RGBA8` and their resolution can be determined with [`atlasSize`](https://shaders.properties/current/reference/uniforms/rendering/#atlassize).

On Iris, additional buffers can be created through through the use of [custom textures](/reference/buffers/custom_textures/), [custom images](/reference/buffers/custom_images/), and [SSBOs](/reference/buffers/ssbo/)
