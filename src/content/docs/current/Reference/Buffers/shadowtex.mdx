### `uniform sampler2D shadowtexN;`

There are two samplers for accessing the shadow depth buffer.
- `shadowtex0` includes all geometry
- `shadowtex1` excludes transparent geometry

#### Writing

These buffers are automatically written to by the [`shadow`](/current/reference/programs/shadow/) and [`shadow_*`](/current/reference/programs/shadow/#additional-shadow-programs-iris-18) programs, and store the screenspace z coordinate at each pixel. You can manually write to this buffer by setting the `gl_FragDepth` variable in the fragment shader. If `gl_FragDepth` is used, it must have a value assigned for all execution paths. For more information see [the OpenGL Docs](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/gl_FragDepth.xhtml).

:::tip
The default (automatic) behavior of writing to the depth buffer is as follows:
```glsl
gl_FragDepth = gl_FragCoord.z;
```

#### Size
These buffers default to the shadow pass resolution, which can be controlled with the [`shadowMapResolution`](/current/reference/constants/shadowmapresolution/) constant.

#### Format / precision

These buffers only store information in a single channel, the r component. The precision is hardware/driver dependent. However, most hardware uses either 24-bit or 32-bit (R24 or R32) precision.

#### Clearing

These buffers all clear to `vec4(1.0)`. This cannot be configured.

#### Flipping

These buffers do not flip.

#### Aliases <Badge text="Legacy" variant="danger" size="medium" />
The alias `waterShadow` points to the same buffer as `shadowtex0`. If `waterShadow` is present anywhere in the code, then the alias `shadow` will point to the same buffer as `shadowtex1`, otherwise it will point to the buffer `shadowtex0`.

## Hardware Sampling
[`shadowHardwareFiltering`](/current/reference/constants/shadowhardwarefiltering/) enables hardware filtering (depth comparison mode). This turns the shadowtex samplers into `sampler2DShadow` samplers, which when sampled take the full `xyz` coordinates of the shadow position. The passed `z` coordinate is then compared to the values in the buffer around the `xy` coordinate, and the result is the weighted average of these comparisons. This produces a filtering effect on the shadow with very little to no performance impact. More information can be found in the [Khronos Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Sampler_Object#Comparison_mode).

When hardware sampling is used, the texture read no longer returns the distance stored in the buffer, but the result of a filtering depth comparison. This prevents its use in algorithms such as PCSS that rely on the actual value stored in the buffer. However, Iris enables the use of separate buffers for hardware sampling, `shadowtex0HW` and `shadowtex1HW`, while retaining the original functionality on the base shadowtex buffers. This requires the [`SEPARATE_HARDWARE_SAMPLERS`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/flags/) feature flag as well as setting [`shadowHardwareFiltering`](/current/reference/constants/shadowhardwarefiltering/) to true.
