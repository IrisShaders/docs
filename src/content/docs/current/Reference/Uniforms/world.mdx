import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These uniforms store information about the world, including world time and day, sun/moon, and weather related values.


## sunPosition
```glsl
uniform vec3 sunPosition;
```
This value stores the position of the sun in view space. The length of the vector is always `100.0`, as it represents a position and not a direction. This value can be converted to screen space directly to get the screen space position of the sun.

```glsl
// equivalent to 'normalize(sunPosition)' or 'sunPosition / length(sunPosition)', since 'length(sunPosition) == 100.0'
vec3 sun_direction = 0.01 * sunPosition;
```

----------------


## moonPosition
```glsl
uniform vec3 moonPosition;
```
This value stores the position of the moon in view space. The length of the vector is always `100.0`, as it represents a position and not a direction. This value can be converted to screen space directly to get the screen space position of the moon.

```glsl
// equivalent to 'normalize(moonPosition)' or 'moonPosition / length(moonPosition)', since 'length(moonPosition) == 100.0'
vec3 moon_direction = 0.01 * moonPosition;
```

----------------


## shadowLightPosition
```glsl
uniform vec3 shadowLightPosition;
```
This value stores the position of the highest celestial body in view space. In the overworld, `shadowLightPosition` is equivalent to [`sunPosition`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#sunposition) during the day and [`moonPosition`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#moonposition) during the night. This matches direction used for the shadow pass. The length of the vector is always `100.0`, as it represents a position and not a direction. This value can be converted to screen space directly to get the screen space position of the celestial body.

```glsl
// equivalent to 'normalize(shadowLightPosition)' or 'shadowLightPosition / length(shadowLightPosition)', since 'length(shadowLightPosition) == 100.0'
vec3 shadow_light_direction = 0.01 * shadowLightPosition;
```

----------------


## sunAngle
```glsl
uniform float sunAngle;
```
This value represents the angle of the sun within the complete day-night cycle. The value ranges from `0` to `1`, where `0` is sunrise, `0.25` is noon, `0.5` is sunset, `0.75` is midnight, etc.

----------------


## shadowAngle
```glsl
uniform float shadowAngle;
```
This value is similar to [`sunAngle`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#sunangle), except it takes its value from the highest celestial body. During the day, the value is equivalent to [`sunAngle`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#sunangle), and during the night it ranges from `0.0` for sunset, `0.25` for midnight, and approaches `0.5` as sunrise approaches. Therefore, the value of `shadowAngle` ranges between `0.0` and `0.5`.

----------------


## moonPhase
```glsl
uniform int moonPhase;
```
This value represents the current moon phase, with `0` being full moon, `1` being waning gibbous, `2` being three quarters, `3` being waning crescent, `4` being new moon, `5` being waxing crescent, `6` being first quarter, and `7` being waxing gibbous.

----------------


## rainStrength
```glsl
uniform float rainStrength;
```
This uniform outputs the current strength of rain and is non-zero when there is currently a rain storm (e.g. weather set rain). The value ranges between `0` to `1` where `0` means no rain and `1` means rain storm, the value is interpolated between those values during transitions in weather.

See also - [`wetness`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#wetness)

----------------


## wetness
```glsl
uniform float wetness;
```
This uniform is equivalent to [`rainStrength`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#rainstrength), except the transition time is controlled with [`wetnessHalfLife`](/current/reference/constants/wetnesshalflife/). The default transition time is also significantly slower.

----------------


## thunderStrength <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float thunderStrength;
```
This value is equivalent to [`rainStrength`](/current/reference/uniforms/world/#rainstrength) but is only non-zero when there is currently a thunder storm (e.g. `weather set thunder`). The value ranges between `0` to `1` where `0` means no thunder and `1` means thunder storm, the value is interpolated between those values during transitions in weather.

----------------


## lightningBoltPosition <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform vec4 lightningBoltPosition;
```
This value reads the player space position of a lightning bolt currently being rendered. If there are none, `vec4(0.0)` is returned. If there is at least one, w is set to `1`. If there are multiple, a random one is chosen.

----------------


## worldTime
```glsl
uniform int worldTime;
```
This value stores the world time within the current day. This value is equivalent to the command `time query daytime`, and can range between `0` and `23999` and resets after each day.

Since the night and day are slightly different lengths, the actual sunrise is at time `23215` and sunset at time `12785` (the times when the sun and moon are exactly equidistant at the horizon).

----------------


## worldDay
```glsl
uniform int worldDay;
```
This value stores the world day, which is the amount of in-game days that have passed since the beginning of the world. This is equivalent to the command `time query day` and the value shown in the f3 menu. This value is reset by any `time set` command.


----------------

## endFlashPosition <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform vec3 endFlashPosition;
```
This value stores the position of the current end flash in view space. The length of the vector is always `100.0`, as it represents a position and not a direction. If [`endFlashShadows`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/features/#endFlashShadows) are enabled, it will be identical to [`shadowLightPosition`].

----------------

## endFlashIntensity <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float endFlashIntensity;
```

This value stores the intensity of the current end flash, maxing out at `1.0`. The sound cue is played at `0.1`. The value will be `0.0` if there is no flash currently occuring.

----------------

## previousEndFlashIntensity <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float previousEndFlashIntensity;
```
This value stores the intensity of the previous end flash, maxing out at `1.0`.
