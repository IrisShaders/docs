### `in vec2 mc_Entity;`

**Valid Programs**: `gbuffers_terrain.vsh`, `gbuffers_water.vsh`, `shadow.vsh`

The `x` component stores the block ID which was assigned to the current block in [`block.properties`](/current/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties/). If an ID for the current block is not defined, a value of `-1.0` is sent.

:::note
OptiFine uses a signed short (16-bit two's complement integer) for `mc_Entity.x`, meaning it can store IDs in the range `[-32768, 32767]`. This matches behavior in Iris [1.3, 1.8), while earlier Iris versions used a 16-bit unsigned integer with a range of `[0, 65535]` and its maximum value for blocks with unassigned IDs, instead of `-1.0`. **Iris versions 1.8 and later use a 31-bit unsigned integer, offset by `-1`. This means that `mc_Entity.x` can store IDs in the range `[-1, 2147483646]`, not accounting for IEEE-754 precision limitations.**

Though the vertex attribute data for `mc_Entity.x` is stored as an integer in Iris 1.8+, it is always cast to a `float` before reading. This comes with significant precision issues at high values, `>= 1.0` at values `>= 16777217.0`.
:::

When [`block.properties`](/current/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties/) isn't present in the shader pack files, block IDs are assigned according to their pre-Minecraft 1.13 numerical values, as described in the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_data_values/Pre-flattening/#Block_IDs). This is intended for legacy purposes, and should not be used for new shader packs.

The `y` component stores the "render type", which is `1.0` for fluids (water, lava, etc.) and `-1.0` for all other blocks.

This attribute is only available for terrain. For other types of geometry, see [`entityid`](/current/reference/uniforms/id/#entityid) and [`blockentityid`](/current/reference/uniforms/id/#blockentityid).
