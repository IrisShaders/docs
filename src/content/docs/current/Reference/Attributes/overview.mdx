**Attributes** are per-vertex data available *only* in the vertex stage. These values encode most of the information that is specific to each vertex, compared to [uniforms](/current/reference/uniforms/overview/) which are the same across all vertices/fragments of a shader. Attribute data can be passed to the fragment stage with a `varying`, or stored to a buffer and read for any other shaders.
