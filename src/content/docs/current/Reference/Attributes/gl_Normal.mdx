### `gl_Normal`
**Valid Programs**: `gbuffers_*.vsh`, `shadow.vsh`

---

The vertex normal vector attribute.

:::note
The vector is not guaranteed to be normalized.
:::

The normal vector from `gl_Normal` is approximate, and in model space (which varies for different geometry). It can be converted to view space using [`gl_NormalMatrix`](/current/reference/uniforms/matrices/#gl_normalmatrix)
```glsl
vec3 normal = gl_NormalMatrix * normalize(gl_Normal);
```

### `in vec3 vaNormal;`
:::danger
This attribute only works with the `core` profile in Minecraft 1.17 and newer. It is recommended to use the `compatibility` profile with Iris for better support. See [this page](/current/how-to/compatibility_vs_core) for more information.

vec3 normal = normalMatrix * normalize(vaNormal);
