### `gl_Color`

**Valid Programs**: `gbuffers_*.vsh`, `shadow.vsh`

The vertex color attribute.

The color attribute is often used to apply tints to colored blocks such as leaves, grass, water, etc. It also contains the [vanilla ambient occlusion](/current/reference/constants/ambientocclusionlevel/) and, if enabled, the [old lighting](/current/reference/shadersproperties/features/#oldlighting).

Enabling [`separateAo`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/features/#separateao) will move the ambient occlusion from the `rgb` components of `vaColor` to the `a` component, which can be applied later like this:
```glsl
vec3 color = gl_Color.rgb * gl_Color.a;
```

### `in vec3 vaColor;`
:::danger
This attribute only works with the `core` profile in Minecraft 1.17 and newer. It is recommended to use the `compatibility` profile with Iris for better support. See [this page](/current/how-to/compatibility_vs_core) for more information.
:::

`vaColor` is the equivalent of `gl_Color` for the [core profile](/current/how-to/compatibility_vs_core/).
