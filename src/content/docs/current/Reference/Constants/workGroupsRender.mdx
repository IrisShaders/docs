Defines a variable number of compute shader work groups to be dispatched based on a multiple of screen resolution. If neither this directive nor [`workGroups`](/current/reference/constants/workGroups/) is defined, work groups will be dispatched as if `workGroupsRender == vec2(1.0, 1.0)`, which means that the smallest number of work groups will be dispatched to completely cover the screen with one shader invocation per pixel when arranged in a grid. If the screen resolution isn't a multiple of `vec2(gl_WorkGroupSize.xy) / workGroupsRender`, the number of invocations dispatched will be greater than the amount of pixels on the screen.

```glsl
gl_NumWorkGroups == uvec3(ceil(vec2(viewWidth, viewHeight) * workGroupsRender / vec2(gl_WorkGroupSize.xy)), 1u)
```
