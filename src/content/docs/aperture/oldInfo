## Object Shaders

Object shaders require special handling to allow for mod support

### Vertex
Vertex shaders should define two functions:

#### `void iris_emitVertex(inout VertexData data)`
Set `data.clipPos` as you would `gl_Position`. Usually this can just be `iris_projectionMatrix * iris_modelViewMatrix * data.modelPos`

:::note[Info]
`iris_projectionMatrix` and `iris_modelViewMatrix` are patched to make sense for the relevant usage, in the same way `gl_ModelViewMatrix` is in OptiFine.
:::

#### `void iris_sendParameters(VertexData data)`
This is where you can write to your `out` declarations.

Both of these functions make use of the `VertexData` struct.

```glsl
struct VertexData {
	vec4 modelPos; // model space position you are given
	vec4 clipPos; // clip space position you must set
	vec2 uv; // texture coordinate in the atlas
	vec2 light; // lightmap texture coordinate - x is blocklight, y is skylight
	vec4 color; // vertex color, equivalent to gl_Color
	vec3 normal; // model space normal
	vec4 tangent; // model space tangent
	vec4 overlayColor; // stuff like the red damage flash, equivalent to entityColor
	vec3 midBlock; // equivalent to at_midBlock
	uint blockId; // hooray
	uint textureId; // ???
	float ao; // vanilla ambient occlusion
};
```

### Fragment

Fragment shaders are a lot simpler, you just define `void iris_emitFragment()` instead of `void main()`.

## Composite Shaders

### Vertex

Since Aperture uses the core profile, `ftransform()` is not patched. Instead, the position of the vertex and the UV must be manually calculated as follows.

```glsl
#version 450 core

out vec2 uv;

void main() {
    vec2 position = vec2(gl_VertexID % 2, gl_VertexID / 2) * 4.0 - 1.0;

    uv = (position + 1.0) * 0.5;

    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

## Buffers

The depth textures are `mainDepthTex` and `solidDepthTex`, replacing `depthtex0` and `depthtex1`.

## Uniforms

A list of available uniforms is printed to the console on Iris startup in the form of the structs they are stored in. As an example of how to access these values, `cameraPosition` is now the `pos` member of the `CameraData` struct, and to access it, we would use `ap.camera.pos`. The same pattern can be applied to any struct.

## Shadows
Iris makes use of cascaded shadow maps, which means everything is a lot more complicated.

### Setting Up the Shadow Pass
You do not need to declare the shadow map, as it is automatically defined. If you want any `shadowcolor` style buffers, declare them as an `ArrayTexture`.

### Sampling the Shadow Map
Aperture defines two shadow maps.
- `shadowMap` (equivalent to `shadowtex0`)
- `solidShadowMap` (equivalent to `shadowtex1`)

Both of these should be defined as `sampler2DArray`s. To sample them, you pass the cascade as the `z` component of your coordinate, i.e:

```glsl
float shadow = step(shadowScreenPos.z, texture(shadowMap, vec3(shadowScreenPos.xy, cascade)));
```

Cascade 0 is the smallest, containing only a small area around the player, and cascade 3 is the largest.

Bear in mind that the shadow projection is also an array, because each cascade has a different projection. As such, to sample the shadow map, you must loop through each projection until your position is inside the frustum.

```glsl
int cascade;
for(cascade = 0; cascade < 4; cascade++){
	shadowClipPos = shadowProjection[cascade] * shadowViewPos;

	if(clamp(shadowClipPos.xy, vec2(-1.0), vec2(1.0)) == shadowClipPos.xy) break;
}
```

### Hardware Filtering
If you want hardware filtering, you can instead use a `sampler2DArrayShadow` and suffix `filtered` to the sampler names (i.e `shadowMapFiltered`. Due to reasons known only to the developers over at Khronos, the cascade is still the `z` component of the coordinate you pass in, so it becomes

```glsl
float shadow = texture(shadowMap, vec4(shadowScreenPos.xy, cascade, shadowScreenPos.z));
```

## Block IDs
The `VertexData` object passed to `iris_sendParameters` has a `blockId` attribute. The following functions can be used on the ID:

```
vec4 iris_getLightColor
uint iris_getMetadata // Raw bitmask, only use if nothing else is enough
bool iris_isFullBlock
bool iris_hasFluid
int iris_getEmission
```

The metadata comes in the form of an 18 bit uint with the following structure

```
0-5:   IS_SIDE_SOLID (6 bits) // DOWN, UP, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST
6-9:   EMISSION (4 bits)
10-13: LIGHT_BLOCK (4 bits)
14-16: DIRECTION (3 bits)
17:    IS_LOWER (1 bit)
18:    IS_FLUID (1 bit)
```
